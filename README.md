This is the first version of an instagram clone I built as my final project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. It is a single-page application with working user authentication using a custom-built API. It can create, delete, update, and get all user photos. The app is currently very barebones and does not have any features aside form a CRUDable resource, which is meant to stand in as a photo resource to be implemented in future iterations.

Again, this project is in its first version, and it will be updated extensively in the future.

Project Development Process:

Build Back-End (database and "photos" resource) using mongoDB and express framework.
Add CSS to Front-End landing page, sign-in and sign-up page, and in-app homepage.
Add CRUD functionality to photo resource.
Problem Solving Strategy: My problem-solving process was largely refined during development of the first iteration of this project. At first I relied on the internet and external sources to guide me through my coding process, but by the end because the same problems were constantly recurring, I was able to identify them over time and solve them from experience. I identified problems by breaking them into solvable components, using debugging and console logging.

Problems to Fix/Long-term Goals:

I will add image upload and capture functionality.
I will add a profile section that will be home to all user settings and photos.
I will add a dynamic photo page that contains all photos from all users.
I will add extensive styling.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to be able to upload my own photos so I can store them in a personal collection.
As a user, I want to be able to see what other people have posted in the app so I can stay up-to-date.
As a user, I want to be able to update a photo caption incase I think of something better to say.
